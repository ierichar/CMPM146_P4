HTN Planning for Minecraft

We decided to implement three heuristics that limits the bot's
inventory, its ability to check whether or not it made a tool,
as well as initializing the made_tool states. The main
heuristic restricts the bot from looping between a set of
operations and methods to produce a certain item. Without the
heuristic, the bot would continually try to produce items with
tools that also require said item.
